# Suction Pool Cleaners

These automatic pool cleaners (APC) are a staple in South African pools and get the job done day in and day out. Automatic swimming pool cleaners form an essential part of a clean and healthy pool. It keeps the sides and bottom of a pool clean at all times. Many people choose to use automatic pool cleaners instead of cleaning their pool manually, because they are efficient, easy to use and they save a lot of time. An automatic pool cleaner is an aquatic vacuum cleaner designed to clean pools with minimal human intervention. Automated swimming pool cleaners work by using the suction generated by the pool pump, collecting sand, dirt and other smaller items from the bottom and sides of your pool and depositing it into the poolâ€™s weir basket.
