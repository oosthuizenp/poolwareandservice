## Cleaners

<p class="lead">
We stock a wide range of automatic pool cleaners manufactured by Zodiac, Gemini and Kreepy Krauly. These automated swimming pool cleaners work by using the pool pump suction which picks up dirt, debris and leaves from the walls and floor where they collect in the poolâ€™s weir basket.</p>
