## SALTWATER CHLORINATORS
Salt chlorinators generate the chlorine necessary to keep your pool free of bacteria and algae. The chlorinator also produces a small amount of ozone which gives your pool that added sparkle and freshness.

The result is healthier water that looks great and feels great too and you can take comfort in the knowledge that your pool is being sanitized even when you arenâ€™t around.

Using chlorine is the proven way of destroying bacteria, viruses and algae in a pool. A salt chlorinator produces its own chlorine when mildly salted water is passed through its electrodes. The level of salt is so low that you can barely taste it. The chlorine dissolves instantly in the pool water, going to work immediately to safely sanitize your pool. Thus eliminating the need for chlorine floaters or granular chlorine products.
