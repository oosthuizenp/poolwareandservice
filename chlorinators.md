# SALTWATER CHLORINATORS
Chlorinators produce their own chlorine through an electrolytic process when the salt water passes through their electrodes. By using low levels of ordinary table salt (NaCl), less than a teaspoon of salt per litre of water these chlorinators generate enough chlorine to keep your pool crystal clear as well as bacteria and algae free.
